        Introduction to Susan Howe<br>By Rebecca Sheehan</strong><br><br>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Susan Howe begins <i>Pierce-Arrow</i> by musing, "Perhaps the word, giving rise to all pictures and
graphs, is at the center
of
Peirce's philosophy. There always was and always will be a secret affinity between symbolic logic and poetry." For literary
theory, Susan Howe's work is revolutionary, its belief in secret affinities transgresses the well-ordered gardens of genre,
discipline and history to arrive at a wilderness where fugitive meaning emerges from encampments least expected. Sandor
Krasna, the narrator of Chris Marker's 1982 film <i>Sans Soleil</i>, tells the story of a Japanese princess who loved lists,
among
those she made was one of "things that quicken the heart." Susan Howe's work is perhaps the heart that quickens things, it not
only finds Emerson's "bare lists of words" suggestive but believes in the relational space, "the thing that's alive with
something from somewhere else," that insists on the value of sensation, imagination and memory, not just as asides, but as
part of that variety of experience with which the individual may challenge history.<br> 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
As Howe's work defends the world remapped by the excited mind it is worth noting that this
is also the work of a brave
and just mind as it listens for the forgotten; the over-looked doodle, the discarded manuscript, the unheard rustle, the
dwindling thought peeking out from a crossed-through sentence, the mispronounced word, the hidden language of the library of
congress, the abandoned train station. <i>The Midnight</i> tells us "It's fun to be hidden but horrible not to be found - the
question is how to be isolated without being insulated." Wielding Zeno's arrow, her work inches towards that thin line where
ante meridium and post meridium meet, the midnight. As it shuttles us through the domain of the liar's paradox, that war of
territory between true and false, self-assertion and negation, it challenges resistance to the coincidence of opposites. A
false sentence from <i>The Midnight</i>, a sassy young voice uttering "The hell with it, we'll both be angels," assures us the
arrow's journey towards the motionless instant is never over, after the true-false stands the good-evil, the end is the
beginning.<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
In this political climate that I will only describe, borrowing an adjective Susan Howe used
yesterday, as "grim,"
believing in the coincidence of opposites is perhaps the only solution to the polarizing and ruinous anthem, "with us or
against us." At one point Howe credits being raised on a diet of Yeats for her obsession with "spirits who inhabit these
books," and who more appropriate to articulate the political significance of her belief in coincidence, her investment in
affinities, than Yeats when he wrote in <i>A Vision</i> that "…they help me to hold in a single thought reality and
justice"?<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Susan Howe is the author of several books of poems and two volumes of criticism. Her most recent poetry collections are
<i>The Midnight</i> (2003), <i>Kidnapped</i> (2002), <i>The Europe of Trusts</i> (2002), and <i>Pierce-Arrow</i> (1999). Her
books of criticism are <i>The
Birth-Mark: Unsettling the Wilderness in American Literary History</i> (1993), which was named an "International Book of the
Year"
by the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>, and <i>My Emily Dickinson</i> (1985). Since 1989 she has been a professor of English
at the
State
University of New York at Buffalo, and is currently the Samuel P. Capen Chair of Poetry and the Humanities. She was elected a
Chancellor of The Academy of American Poets in 2000.<br>
