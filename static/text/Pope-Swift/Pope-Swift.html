<br>
1          Shut, shut the door, good John! fatigu'd I said,<br>
2          Tye up the knocker, say I'm sick, I'm dead.<br>
3          The Dog-star rages! nay 'tis past a doubt,<br>
4          All Bedlam, or Parnassus, is let out:<br>
5          Fire in each eye, and papers in each hand,<br>
6          They rave, recite, and madden round the land.<br>
<br>
7          What walls can guard me, or what shades can hide?<br>
8          They pierce my thickets, thro' my Grot they glide,<br>
9          By land, by water, they renew the charge,<br>
10        They stop the chariot, and they board the barge.<br>
11        No place is sacred, not the Church is free,<br>
12        Ev'n Sunday shines no Sabbath-day to me:<br>
13        Then from the Mint walks forth the man of rhyme,<br>
14        Happy! to catch me, just at dinner-time.<br>
<br>
15        Is there a parson, much be-mus'd in beer,<br>
16        A maudling poetess, a ryming peer,<br>
17        A clerk, foredoom'd his father's soul to cross,<br>
18        Who pens a stanza when he should engross?<br>
19        Is there, who lock'd from ink and paper, scrawls<br>
20        With desp'rate charcoal round his darken'd walls?<br>
21        All fly to Twit'nam and in humble strain<br>
22        Apply to me, to keep them mad, or vain.<br>
23        Arthur, whose giddy son neglects the laws,<br>
24        Imputes to me and my damn'd works the cause:<br>
25        Poor Cornus sees his frantic wife elope,<br>
26        And curses wit, and poetry, and Pope.<br>
<br>
27        Friend to my Life! (which did not you prolong,<br>
28        The world had wanted many an idle song)<br>
29        What Drop or Nostrum can this plague remove?<br>
30        Or which must end me, a fool's wrath or love?<br>
31        A dire dilemma! either way I'm sped,<br>
32        If foes, they write, if friends, they read me dead.<br>
33        Seiz'd and ty'd down to judge, how wretched I,<br>
34        Who can't be silent, and who will not lye;<br>
35        To laugh, were want of goodness-and-of-grace,<br>
36        And to be grave, exceeds all pow'r of face.<br>
<br>
37        I sit with sad civility, I read<br>
38        With honest anguish, and an aching head;<br>
39        And drop at last, but in unwilling ears,<br>
40        This saving council, "Keep your piece nine years."<br>
<br>
41        Nine years! cries he, who high in Drury-lane<br>
42        Lull'd by soft Zephyrs thro' the broken pane,<br>
43        Rymes 'ere he wakes, and prints before Term ends,<br>
44        Oblig'd by hunger, and request of friends:<br>
45        "The piece you think is incorrect? why take it,<br>
46        "I'm all submission, what you'd have it, make it."<br>
<br>
47        Three things another's modest wishes bound,<br>
48        My friendship, and a Prologue, and ten pound.<br>
<br>
49        Pitholeon sends to me: "You know his Grace,<br>
50        "I want a patron; ask him for a place."<br>
51        Pitholeon libell'd me---"but here's a letter<br>
52        "Informs you, sir, 'twas when he knew no better.<br>
53        "Dare you refuse him? Curl invites to dine!<br>
54        "He'll write a Journal, or he'll turn Divine."<br>
<br>
55        Bless me! a packet.---"'Tis a stranger sues,<br>
56        "A Virgin Tragedy, an Orphan Muse."<br>
57        If I dislike it, "Furies, death and rage!<br>
58        If I approve, "commend it to the Stage."<br>
59        There (thank my stars) my whole commission ends,<br>
60        The Players and I are, luckily, no friends.<br>
61        Fir'd that the house reject him, "'Sdeath I'll print it<br>
62        "And shame the fools---your int'rest, sir, with Lintot."<br>
63        Lintot, dull rogue! will think your price too much.<br>
64        "Not sir, if you revise it, and retouch."<br>
65        All my demurs but double his attacks,<br>
66        At last he whispers, "do, and we go snacks.<br>
67        Glad of a quarrel, strait I clap the door,<br>
68        Sir, let me see your works and you no more.<br>
<br>
69        'Tis sung, when Midas' Ears began to spring,<br>
70        (Midas, a sacred person and a King)<br>
71        His very Minister who spy'd them first,<br>
72        (Some say his Queen) was forc'd to speak, or burst.<br>
73        And is not mine, my friend, a sorer case,<br>
74        When ev'ry coxcomb perks them in my face,<br>
75        "Good friend forbear! you deal in dang'rous things,<br>
76        "I'd never name Queens, ministers or kings;<br>
77        "Keep close to ears, and those let asses prick,<br>
78        "'Tis nothing"---Nothing if they bite and kick?<br>
79        Out with it, Dunciad! let the secret pass,<br>
80        That secret to each fool, that he's an ass:<br>
81        The truth once told, (and wherefore should we lie?)<br>
82        The Queen of Midas slept, and so may I.<br>
<br>
83        You think this cruel? take it for a rule,<br>
84        No creature smarts so little as a fool.<br>
85        Let peals of laughter, Codrus! round thee break,<br>
86        Thou unconcern'd canst hear the mighty crak:<br>
87        Pit, box, and gall'ry in convulsions hurl'd,<br>
88        Thou stand'st unshook amidst a bursting world.<br>
89        Who shames a Scribler? break one cobweb thro',<br>
90        He spins the slight, self-pleasing thread anew:<br>
91        Destroy his fib, or sophistry, in vain,<br>
92        The creature's at his dirty work again;<br>
93        Thron'd in the centre of his thin designs,<br>
94        Proud of a vast extent of flimzy lines!<br>
95        Whom have I hurt? has Poet yet, or Peer,<br>
96        Lost the arch'd eye-brow, or Parnassian sneer?<br>
97        And has not Colly still his lord, and whore?<br>
98        His butchers Henley, his free-masons Moore?<br>
99        Does not one table Arnall still admit?<br>
100      Still to one Bishop Phillips seem a wit?<br>
101      Still Sappho---"Hold! for God-sake---you'll offend,<br>
102      "No names---be calm---learn prudence of a friend:<br>
103      "I too could write, and I am twice as tall,<br>
104      "But foes like these!---One Flatt'rers worse than all;<br>
105      Of all mad creatures, if the learn'd are right,<br>
106      It is the slaver kills, and not the bite.<br>
107      A fool quite angry is quite innocent;<br>
108      Alas! 'tis ten times worse when they repent.<br>
<br>
109      One dedicates in high heroic prose,<br>
110      And ridicules beyond a hundred foes;<br>
111      One from all Grub-street will my fame defend,<br>
112      And, more abusive, calls himself my friend.<br>
113      This prints my Letters, or expects a bribe,<br>
114      And others roar aloud, "Subscribe, subscribe."<br>
<br>
115      There are, who to my person pay their court,<br>
116      I cough like Horace, and tho' lean, am short,<br>
117      Ammon's great son one shoulder had too high,<br>
118      Such Ovid's nose, and Sir! you have an Eye---<br>
119      Go on, obliging creatures, make me see<br>
120      All that disgrac'd my betters, met in me.<br>
121      Say for my comfort, languishing in bed,<br>
122      "Just so immortal Maro held his head:<br>
123      And when I die, be sure you let me know,<br>
124      Great Homer dy'd three thousand years ago.<br>
<br>
125      Why did I write? what sin to me unknown<br>
126      Dipt me in Ink, my parents, or my own?<br>
127      As yet a child, nor yet a fool to fame,<br>
128      I lisp'd in numbers, for the numbers came.<br>
129      I left no calling for this idle trade.<br>
130      No duty broke, no father disobey'd.<br>
131      The Muse but serv'd to ease some friend, not Wife,<br>
132      To help me thro' this long disease, my life,<br>
133      To second, Arbuthnot! thy Art and care,<br>
134      And teach, the Being you preserv'd, to bear.<br>
<br>
135      But why then publish? Granville the polite,<br>
136      And knowing Walsh, would tell me I could write,<br>
137      Well-natur'd Garth inflam'd with early praise,<br>
138      And Congreve lov'd, and Swift endur'd my lays;<br>
139      The courtly Talbot, Somers, Sheffield read,<br>
140      Ev'n mitred Rochester would nod the head,<br>
141      And St. John's self (great Dryden's friend before)<br>
142      With open arms receiv'd one Poet more.<br>
143      Happy my studies, when by these approv'd!<br>
144      Happier their author, when by these belov'd!<br>
145      From these the world will judge of men and books,<br>
146      Not from the Burnets, Oldmixons, and Cooks.<br>
<br>
147      Soft were my numbers, who could take offence<br>
148      While pure Description held the place of sense;<br>
149      Like gentle Fanny's was my flow'ry theme,<br>
150      A painted mistress, or a purling stream.<br>
151      Yet then did Gildon draw his venal quill;<br>
152      I wish'd the man a dinner, and fate still:<br>
153      Yet then did Dennis rave in furious fret;<br>
154      I never answer'd, I was not in debt:<br>
155      If want provok'd, or madness made them print,<br>
156      I wag'd no war with Bedlam or the Mint.<br>
<br>
157      Did some more sober Critics come abroad?<br>
158      If wrong, I smil'd; if right, I kiss'd the rod.<br>
159      Pains, reading, study, are their just pretence,<br>
160      And all they want is spirit, taste, and sense.<br>
161      Comma's and points they set exactly right.<br>
162      And 'twere a sin to rob them of their mite.<br>
163      Yet ne'er one sprig of laurel grac'd these ribalds,<br>
164      From slashing Bentley down to pidling Tibalds.<br>
165      Each wight who reads not, only scans and spells,<br>
166      Each word-catcher who lives on syllables,<br>
167      Ev'n such small critics some regard may claim,<br>
168      Preserv'd in Milton's or in Shakespear's name.<br>
169      Pretty! in amber to observe the forms<br>
170      Of hairs, or straws, or dirt, or grubs, or worms!<br>
171      The things, we know, are neither rich nor rare,<br>
172      But wonder how the devil they got there?<br>
<br>
173      Were others angry? I excus'd them too;<br>
174      Well might they rage, I gave them but their due.<br>
175      A man's true merit 'tis not hard to find,<br>
176      But each man's secret standard in his mind,<br>
177      That casting-weight pride adds to emptiness,<br>
178      This, who can gratify? For who can guess?<br>
179      The Bard whom pilf'red Pastorels renown,<br>
180      Who turns a Persian tale for half a crown,<br>
181      Just writes to make his barrenness appear,<br>
182      And strains, from hard-bound brains, eight lines a year:<br>
183      He, who still wanting, tho' he lives on theft,<br>
184      Steals much, spends little, yet has nothing left:<br>
185      And he, who now to sense, now nonsense leaning,<br>
186      Means not, but blunders round about a meaning:<br>
187      And he, whose fustian's so sublimely bad,<br>
188      It is not poetry, but prose run mad:<br>
189      All these, my modest satire bad translate,<br>
190      And own'd, that nine such poets made a Tate.<br>
191      How did they fume, and stamp, and roar, and chafe?<br>
192      And swear, not Addison himself was safe.<br>
<br>
193      Peace to all such! but were there one whose fires<br>
194      True Genius kindles, and fair Fame inspires,<br>
195      Blest with each talent, and each art to please,<br>
196      And born to write, converse, and live with ease:<br>
197      Shou'd such a man, too fond to rule alone,<br>
198      Bear, like the Turk, no brother near the throne,<br>
199      View him with scornful, yet with jealous eyes,<br>
200      And hate for arts that caus'd himself to rise;<br>
201      Damn with faint praise, assent with civil leer,<br>
202      And without sneering, teach the rest to sneer;<br>
203      Willing to wound, and yet afraid to strike,<br>
204      Just hint a fault, and hesitate dislike;<br>
205      Alike reserv'd to blame, or to commend,<br>
206      A tim'rous foe, and a suspicious friend;<br>
207      Dreading ev'n fools, by Flatterers besieg'd,<br>
208      And so obliging that he ne'er oblig'd;<br>
209      Like Cato, give his little Senate laws,<br>
210      And sit attentive to his own applause;<br>
211      While Wits and Templers ev'ry sentence raise,<br>
212      And wonder with a foolish face of praise:<br>
213      Who but must laugh if such a man there be?<br>
214      Who would not weep, if Atticus were he?<br>
<br>
215      What tho' my Name stood rubric on the walls?<br>
216      Or plaster'd posts, with claps in capitals?<br>
217      Or smoaking forth, a hundred hawkers load,<br>
218      On wings of winds came flying all abroad,<br>
219      I sought no homage from the race that write;<br>
220      I kept, like Asian monarchs, from their sight;<br>
221      Poems I heeded (now be rym'd so long)<br>
222      No more than thou, great George! a birth-day song.<br>
223      I ne'er with wits nor witlings past my days,<br>
224      To spread about the itch of verse and praise;<br>
225      Nor like a puppy, daggled through the town,<br>
226      To fetch and carry sing-song up and down;<br>
227      Nor at Rehearsals sweat, and mouth'd, and cry'd,<br>
228      With handkerchief and orange at my side;<br>
229      But sick of fops, and poetry, and prate,<br>
230      To Bufo left the whole Castalian state.<br>
<br>
231      Proud, as Apollo on his forked hill,<br>
232      Sate full blown Bufo puff'd by ev'ry quill;<br>
233      Fed with soft Dedication all day long,<br>
234      Horace and he went hand in hand in song.<br>
235      His Library, (where busts of poets dead<br>
236      And a true Pindar stood without a head)<br>
237      Receiv'd of wits an undistinguish'd race,<br>
238      Who first his judgment ask'd, and then a place:<br>
239      Much they extoll'd his pictures, much his seat,<br>
240      And flatter'd ev'ry day, and some days eat:<br>
241      Till grown more frugal in his riper days,<br>
242      He pay'd some bards with port, and some with praise,<br>
243      To some a dry rehearsal was assign'd,<br>
244      And others (harder still) he paid in kind.<br>
245      Dryden alone (what wonder?) came not nigh,<br>
246      Dryden alone escap'd this judging eye.<br>
247      But still the great have kindness in reserve,<br>
248      He help'd to bury him he help'd to starve.<br>
<br>
249      May some choice Patron bless each gray goose quill!<br>
250      May ev'ry Bavius have his Bufo still!<br>
251      So, when a Statesman wants a day's defence,<br>
252      Or Envy holds a whole week's war with sense,<br>
253      Or simple pride for flatt'ry makes demands,<br>
254      May dunce by dunce be whistled off my hands!<br>
255      Blest be the Great, for those they take away,<br>
256      And those they left me---For they left me Gay;<br>
257      Left me to see neglected genius bloom,<br>
258      Neglected die, and tell it on his tomb:<br>
259      Of all thy blameless life the sole return,<br>
260      My Verse, and Queensb'ry weeping o'er thy urn!<br>
<br>
261      Oh, let me live my own, and die so too!<br>
262      ("To live and die is all I have to do)<br>
263      Maintain a Poet's dignity and ease,<br>
264      And see what friends, and read what books I please:<br>
<br>
265      Above a Patron, tho' I condescend<br>
266      Sometimes to call a Minister my friend.<br>
267      I was not born for courts or great affairs:<br>
268      I pay my debts, believe, and say my pray'rs;<br>
269      Can sleep without a poem in my head,<br>
270      Nor know, if Dennis be alive or dead.<br>
<br>
271      Why am I ask'd, what next shall see the light?<br>
272      Heav'ns! was I born for nothing but to write?<br>
273      Has life no joys for me? or, to be grave,<br>
274      Have I no friend to serve, no soul to save?<br>
275      "I found him close with Swift---Indeed? no doubt<br>
276      "(Cries prating Balbus) something will come out.<br>
277      'Tis all in vain, deny it as I will.<br>
278      "No, such a Genius never can lie still."<br>
279      And then for mine obligingly mistakes<br>
280      The first lampoon Sir Will. or Bubo makes,<br>
281      Poor guiltless I! and can I chuse but smile,<br>
282      When ev'ry coxcomb knows me by my Style?<br>
<br>
283      Curst be the verse, how well soe'er it flow,<br>
284      That tends to make one worthy man my foe,<br>
285      Give Virtue scandal, Innocence a fear,<br>
286      Or from the soft-ey'd virgin steal a tear!<br>
287      But he who hurts a harmless neighbour's peace,<br>
288      Insults fall'n worth, or beauty in distress,<br>
289      Who loves a lye, lame slander helps about,<br>
290      Who writes a libel, or who copies out:<br>
291      That fop, whose pride affects a patron's name,<br>
292      Yet absent, wounds an author's honest fame;<br>
293      Who can your merit selfishly approve,<br>
294      And show the sense of it without the love;<br>
295      Who has the vanity to call you friend,<br>
296      Yet wants the honour injur'd to defend:<br>
297      Who tells whate'er you think, whate'er you say,<br>
298      And, if he lye not, must at least betray:<br>
299      Who to the Dean and silver bell can swear,<br>
300      And sees at Cannon's what was never there;<br>
301      Who reads, but with a lust to misapply,<br>
302      Make Satire a lampoon, and Fiction lye.<br>
303      A lash like mine no honest man shall dread,<br>
304      But all such babling blockheads in his stead.<br>
<br>
305      Let Sporus tremble---"What? that thing of silk,<br>
306      "Sporus, that mere white curd of Ass's milk?<br>
307      "Satire or sense alas! can Sporus feel?<br>
308      "Who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel?"<br>
309      Yet let me flap this bug with gilded wings,<br>
310      This painted child of dirt, that stinks and stings,<br>
311      Whose buzz the witty and the fair annoys,<br>
312      Yet wit ne'er tastes, and beauty ne'er enjoys:<br>
313      So well-bred spaniels civilly delight<br>
314      In mumbling of the game they dare not bite.<br>
315      Eternal smiles his emptiness betray,<br>
316      As shallow streams run dimpling all the way.<br>
317      Whether in florid impotence he speaks,<br>
318      And, as the prompter breathes, the puppet squeaks;<br>
319      Or at the ear of Eve, familiar toad,<br>
320      Half froth, half venom, spits himself abroad,<br>
321      In puns, or politicks, or tales, or lyes,<br>
322      Or spite, or smut, or rymes, or blasphemies.<br>
323      His wit all see-saw between that and this,<br>
324      Now high, now low, now master up, now miss,<br>
325      And he himself one vile Antithesis.<br>
326      Amphibious thing! that acting either part,<br>
327      The trifling head, or the corrupted heart,<br>
328      Fop at the toilet, flat'trer at the board,<br>
329      Now trips a Lady, and now struts a Lord.<br>
330      Eve's tempter thus the Rabbins have exprest,<br>
331      A Cherub's face, a reptile all the rest,<br>
332      Beauty that shocks you, parts that none can trust,<br>
333      Wit that can creep, and Pride that licks the dust.<br>
<br>
334      Not Fortune's worshipper, nor Fashion's fool,<br>
335      Nor Lucre's madman, nor Ambition's tool,<br>
336      Not proud, nor servile; be one Poet's praise,<br>
337      That, if he pleas'd, he pleas'd by manly ways;<br>
338      That Flatt'ry, ev'n to Kings, he held a shame,<br>
339      And thought a Lye in verse or prose the same:<br>
340      That not in Fancy's maze he wander'd long,<br>
341      But stoop'd to Truth, and moraliz'd his song:<br>
342      That not for Fame, but Virtue's better end,<br>
343      He stood the furious foe, the timid friend,<br>
344      The damning critic, half approving wit,<br>
345      The coxcomb hit, or fearing to be hit;<br>
346      Laugh'd at the loss of friends he never had,<br>
347      The dull, the proud, the wicked, or the mad;<br>
348      The distant threats of vengeance on his head,<br>
349      The blow unfelt, the tear he never shed?<br>
350      The tale reviv'd, the lye so oft o'erthrown,<br>
351      Th'imputed trash, and dulness not his own,<br>
352      The morals blacken'd when the writings scape,<br>
353      The libel'd person, and the pictur'd shape;<br>
354      Abuse, on all he lov'd, or lov'd him, spread,<br>
355      A friend in exile, or a father, dead;<br>
356      The Whisper, that to greatness still too near,<br>
357      Perhaps, yet vibrates on his Sovereign's ear---<br>
358      Welcome for thee, fair Virtue! all the past:<br>
359      For thee, fair Virtue! welcome even the last!<br>
<br>
360      "But why insult the poor, affront the great?"<br>
361      A knave's a knave, to me, in ev'ry state:<br>
362      Alike my scorn, if he succeed or fail,<br>
363      Sporus at court, or Japhet in a jayl,<br>
364      A hireling scribler, or a hireling peer,<br>
365      Knight of the post corrupt, or of the shire,<br>
366      If on a Pillory, or near a Throne,<br>
367      He gain his Prince's ear, or lose his own.<br>
<br>
368      Yet soft by nature, more a dupe than wit,<br>
369      Sapho can tell you how this man was bit:<br>
370      This dreaded Sat'rist Dennis will confess<br>
371      Foe to his pride, but friend to his distress:<br>
372      So humble, he has knock'd at Tibbald's door,<br>
373      Has drunk with Cibber, nay has rhym'd for Moor:<br>
374      Full ten years slander'd, did he once reply?<br>
375      Three thousand suns went down on Welsted's lye:<br>
376      To please a mistress one aspers'd his life,<br>
377      He lash'd him not, but let her be his wife:<br>
378      Let Budgel charge low Grubstreet on his quill,<br>
379      Ann write whate'er he pleas'd except his will;<br>
380      Let the two Curls of Town and Court, abuse<br>
381      His father, mother, body, soul, and muse.<br>
382      Yet why? that Father held it for a rule<br>
383      It was a sin to call our neighbour fool,<br>
384      That harmless Mother thought no wife a whore;<br>
385      Hear this, and spare his family, James More!<br>
386      Unspotted names, and memorable long,<br>
387      If there be force in Virtue, or in Song.<br>
<br>
388      Of gentle blood (part shed in Honour's cause,<br>
389      While yet in Britain Honour had applause)<br>
390      Each parent sprang---"What fortune, pray?---their own,<br>
391      And better got than Bestia's from the Throne.<br>
392      Born to no Pride, inheriting no Strife,<br>
393      Nor marrying discord in a noble wife,<br>
394      Stranger to civil and religious rage,<br>
395      The good man walk'd inoxious thro' his age:<br>
396      No Courts he saw, no suits would ever try,<br>
397      Nor dar'd an Oath, nor hazarded a lye:<br>
398      Un-learn'd, he knew no schoolman's subtile art,<br>
399      No language, but the language of the heart:<br>
400      By nature honest, by experience wise,<br>
401      Healthy by temp'rance, and by exercise,<br>
402      His life, tho' long, to sickness past unknown,<br>
403      His death was instant, and without a groan.<br>
404      O grant me thus to live, and thus to die!<br>
405      Who sprung from Kings shall know less joy than I.<br>
<br>
406      O Friend! may each domestic bliss be thine!<br>
407      Be no unpleasing Melancholy mine:<br>
408      Me, let the tender office long engage<br>
409      To rock the cradle of reposing Age,<br>
410      With lenient arts extend a Mother's breath,<br>
411      Make languor smile, and smooth the bed of death,<br>
412      Explore the thought, explain the asking eye,<br>
413      And keep a while one parent from the sky!<br>
414      On cares like these if length of days attend,<br>
415      May heav'n, to bless those days, preserve my friend,<br>
416      Preserve him social, chearful, and serene,<br>
417      And just as rich as when he serv'd a Queen.<br>
418      Whether that blessing be deny'd or giv'n,<br>
419      Thus far was right, the rest belongs to Heav'n.<br>

1          What dire offence from am'rous causes springs,<br>
2          What mighty contests rise from trivial things,<br>
3          I sing---This verse to C---, Muse! is due:<br>
4          This, ev'n Belinda may vouchsafe to view:<br>
5          Slight is the subject, but not so the praise,<br>
6          If She inspire, and He approve my lays.<br>
<br>
7          Say what strange motive, Goddess! could compel<br>
8          A well-bred Lord t'assault a gentle Belle?<br>
9          Oh say what stranger cause, yet unexplor'd,<br>
10        Cou'd make a gentle Belle reject a Lord?<br>
11        In tasks so bold, can little men engage,<br>
12        And in soft bosoms dwells such mighty Rage?<br>
13        Sol thro' white curtains shot a tim'rous ray,<br>
14        And ope'd those eyes that must eclipse the day;<br>
15        Now lap-dogs give themselves the rousing shake,<br>
16        And sleepless lovers, just at twelve, awake:<br>
17        Thrice rung the bell, the slipper knock'd the ground,<br>
18        And the press'd watch return'd a silver sound.<br>
19        Belinda still her downy pillow prest,<br>
20        Her guardian Sylph prolong'd the balmy rest:<br>
21        'Twas he had summon'd to her silent bed<br>
22        The morning-dream that hover'd o'er her head.<br>
23        A Youth more glitt'ring than a Birth-night Beau,<br>
24        (That ev'n in slumber caus'd her cheek to glow)<br>
25        Seem'd to her ear his winning lips to lay,<br>
26        And thus in whispers said, or seem'd to say.<br>
27        Fairest of mortals, thou distinguish'd care<br>
28        Of thousand bright Inhabitants of Air!<br>
29        If e'er one Vision touch'd thy infant thought,<br>
30        Of all the Nurse and all the Priest have taught;<br>
31        Of airy Elves by moonlight shadows seen,<br>
32        The silver token, and the circled green,<br>
33        Or virgins visited by Angel-pow'rs,<br>
34        With golden crowns and wreaths of heav'nly flow'rs;<br>
35        Hear and believe! thy own importance know,<br>
36        Nor bound thy narrow views to things below.<br>
37        Some secret truths, from learned pride conceal'd,<br>
38        To Maids alone and Children are reveal'd:<br>
39        What tho' no credit doubting Wits may give?<br>
40        The Fair and Innocent shall still believe.<br>
41        Know then, unnumber'd Spirits round thee fly,<br>
42        The light Militia of the lower sky;<br>
43        These, tho' unseen, are ever on the wing,<br>
44        Hang o'er the Box, and hover round the Ring:<br>
45        Think what an Equipage thou hast in Air,<br>
46        And view with scorn two Pages and a Chair.<br>
47        As now your own, our beings were of old,<br>
48        And once inclos'd in Woman's beauteous mold;<br>
49        Thence, by a soft transition, we repair<br>
50        From earthly Vehicles to these of air.<br>
51        Think not, when Woman's transient breath is fled,<br>
52        That all her vanities at once are dead:<br>
53        Succeeding vanities she still regards,<br>
54        And tho' she plays no more, o'erlooks the cards.<br>
55        Her joy in gilded Chariots, when alive,<br>
56        And love of Ombre, after death survive.<br>
57        For when the Fair in all their pride expire,<br>
58        To their first Elements the Souls retire:<br>
59        The Sprites of fiery Termagants in Flame<br>
60        Mount up, and take a Salamander's name.<br>
61        Soft yielding minds to Water glide away,<br>
62        And sip, with Nymphs, their elemental Tea.<br>
63        The graver Prude sinks downward to a Gnome,<br>
64        In search of mischief still on Earth to roam.<br>
65        The light Coquettes in Sylphs aloft repair,<br>
66        And sport and flutter in the fields of Air.<br>
<br>
67        Know farther yet; whoever fair and chaste<br>
68        Rejects mankind, is by some Sylph embrac'd:<br>
69        For Spirits, freed from mortal laws, with ease<br>
70        Assume what sexes and what shapes they please.<br>
71        What guards the purity of melting Maids<br>
72        In courtly balls, and midnight masquerades,<br>
73        Safe from the treach'rous friend, the daring spark,<br>
74        The glance by day, the whisper in the dark,<br>
75        When kind occasion prompts their warm desires,<br>
76        When music softens, and when dancing fires?<br>
77        'Tis but their Sylph, the wise Celestials know,<br>
78        Tho' Honour is the word with Men below.<br>
<br>
79        Some nymphs there are, too conscious of their face,<br>
80        For life predestin'd to the Gnomes embrace.<br>
81        These swell their prospects and exalt their pride,<br>
82        When offers are disdain'd, and love deny'd:<br>
83        Then gay Ideas croud the vacant brain,<br>
84        While Peers and Dukes, and all their sweeping train,<br>
85        And Garters, Stars, and Coronets appear,<br>
86        And in soft sounds, Your Grace salutes their ear.<br>
87        'Tis these that early taint the female soul,<br>
88        Instruct the eyes of young Coquettes to roll,<br>
89        Teach Infants cheeks a bidden blush to know,<br>
90        And little hearts to flutter at a Beau.<br>
<br>
91        Oft' when the world imagine women stray,<br>
92        The Sylphs thro' mystic mazes guide their way,<br>
93        Thro' all the giddy circle they pursue,<br>
94        And old impertinence expel by new.<br>
95        What tender maid but must a victim fall<br>
96        To one man's treat, but for another's ball?<br>
97        When Florio speaks, what virgin could withstand,<br>
98        If gentle Damon did not squeeze her hand?<br>
99        With varying vanities, from ev'ry part,<br>
100      They shift the moving Toyshop of their heart;<br>
101      Where wigs with wigs, with sword-knots sword-knots strive,<br>
102      Beaus banish beaus, and coaches coaches drive.<br>
103      This erring mortals Levity may call,<br>
104      Oh blind to truth! the Sylphs contrive it all.<br>
<br>
105      Of these am I, who thy protection claim,<br>
106      A watchful sprite, and Ariel is my name.<br>
107      Late, as I rang'd the crystal wilds of air,<br>
108      In the clear Mirror of thy ruling Star<br>
109      I saw, alas! some dread event impend,<br>
110      E'er to the main this morning sun descend.<br>
111      But heav'n reveals not what, or how, or where:<br>
112      Warn'd by thy Sylph, oh pious maid, beware!<br>
113      This to disclose is all thy guardian can.<br>
114      Beware of all, but most beware of Man!<br>
115      He said; when Shock, who thought she slept too long,<br>
116      Leap'd up, and wak'd his mistress with his tongue.<br>
117      'Twas then Belinda, if report say true,<br>
118      Thy eyes first open'd on a Billet-doux;<br>
119      Wounds, Charms, and Ardors, were no sooner read,<br>
120      But all the Vision vanish'd from thy head.<br>
121      And now, unveil'd, the Toilet stands display'd,<br>
122      Each silver Vase in mystic order laid.<br>
123      First, robe'd in white, the nymph intent adores<br>
124      With head uncover'd, the Cosmetic pow'rs.<br>
125      A heav'nly Image in the glass appears,<br>
126      To that she bends, to that her eyes she rears;<br>
127      Th'inferior Priestess, at her altar's side,<br>
128      Trembling, begins the sacred rites of Pride.<br>
129      Unnumber'd treasures ope at once, and here<br>
130      The various off'rings of the world appear;<br>
131      From each she nicely culls with curious toil,<br>
132      And decks the Goddess with the glitt'ring spoil.<br>
133      This casket India's glowing gems unlocks,<br>
134      And all Arabia breathes from yonder box.<br>
135      The Tortoise here and Elephant unite,<br>
136      Transform'd to combs, the speckled, and the white.<br>
137      Here files of pins extend their shining rows,<br>
138      Puffs, Powders, Patches, Bibles, Billet-doux.<br>
139      Now awful Beauty puts on all its arms;<br>
140      The fair each moment rises in her charms,<br>
141      Repairs her smiles, awakens ev'ry grace,<br>
142      And calls forth all the wonders of her face;<br>
143      Sees by degrees a purer blush arise,<br>
144      And keener lightnings quicken in her eyes.<br>
145      The busy Sylphs surround their darling care,<br>
146      These set the head, and those divide the hair,<br>
147      Some fold the sleeve, whilst others plait the gown;<br>
148      And Betty's prais'd for labours not her own.<br>

1          Not with more glories, in th'etherial plain,<br>
2          The Sun first rises o'er the purpled main,<br>
3          Than issuing forth, the rival of his beams<br>
4          Lanch'd on the bosom of the silver Thames.<br>
5          Fair Nymphs, and well-drest Youths around her shone,<br>
6          But ev'ry eye was fix'd on her alone.<br>
7          On her white breast a sparkling Cross she wore,<br>
8          Which Jews might kiss, and Infidels adore.<br>
9          Her lively looks a sprightly mind disclose,<br>
10        Quick as her eyes, and as unfix'd as those:<br>
11        Favours to none, to all she smiles extends,<br>
12        Oft' she rejects, but never once offends.<br>
13        Bright as the sun, her eyes the gazers strike,<br>
14        And, like the sun, they shine on all alike.<br>
15        Yet graceful ease, and sweetness void of pride<br>
16        Might hide her faults, if Belles had faults to hide:<br>
17        If to her share some female errors fall,<br>
18        Look on her face, and you'll forget 'em all.<br>
<br>
19        This Nymph, to the destruction of mankind,<br>
20        Nourish'd two Locks, which graceful hung behind<br>
21        In equal curls, and well conspir'd to deck<br>
22        With shining ringlets the smooth iv'ry neck:<br>
23        Love in these labyrinths his slaves detains,<br>
24        And mighty hearts are held in slender chains.<br>
25        With hairy sprindges we the birds betray,<br>
26        Slight lines of hair surprize the finny prey,<br>
27        Fair tresses man's imperial race insnare,<br>
28        And beauty draws us with a single hair.<br>
<br>
29        Th'advent'rous Baron the bright locks admir'd,<br>
30        He saw, he wish'd, and to the prize aspir'd.<br>
31        Resolv'd to win, he meditates the way,<br>
32        By force to ravish, or by fraud betray;<br>
33        For when success a Lover's toil attends,<br>
34        Few ask, if fraud or force attain'd his ends.<br>
<br>
35        For this, e'er Phoebus rose, he had implor'd<br>
36        Propitious heav'n, and ev'ry pow'r ador'd,<br>
37        But chiefly Love---to Love an altar built,<br>
38        Of twelve vast French Romances, neatly gilt.<br>
39        There lay three garters, half a pair of gloves;<br>
40        And all the trophies of his former loves.<br>
41        With tender Billet-doux he lights the pyre,<br>
42        And breathes three am'rous sighs to raise the fire.<br>
43        Then prostrate falls, and begs with ardent eyes<br>
44        Soon to obtain, and long possess the prize:<br>
45        The Pow'rs gave ear, and granted half his pray'r,<br>
46        The rest, the winds dispers'd in empty air.<br>
47        But now secure the painted vessel glides,<br>
48        The sun-beams trembling on the floating tydes;<br>
49        While melting music steals upon the sky,<br>
50        And soften'd sounds along the waters die;<br>
51        Smooth flow the waves, the Zephyrs gently play,<br>
52        Belinda smil'd, and all the world was gay.<br>
53        All but the Sylph---with careful thoughts opprest,<br>
54        Th'impending woe sate heavy on his breast.<br>
55        He summons strait his Denizens of air;<br>
56        The lucid squadrons round the sails repair:<br>
57        Soft o'er the shrouds aerial whispers breathe,<br>
58        That seem'd but Zephyrs to the train beneath.<br>
59        Some to the sun their insect-wings unfold,<br>
60        Waft on the breeze, or sink in clouds of gold;<br>
61        Transparent forms, too fine for mortal sight,<br>
62        Their fluid bodies half dissolv'd in light.<br>
63        Loose to the wind their airy garments flew,<br>
64        Thin glitt'ring textures of the filmy dew,<br>
65        Dipt in the richest tincture of the skies,<br>
66        Where light disports in ever-mingling dyes,<br>
67        While ev'ry beam new transient colours flings,<br>
68        Colours that change whene'er they wave their wings.<br>
69        Amid the circle, on the gilded mast,<br>
70        Superior by the head, was Ariel plac'd;<br>
71        His purple pinions opening to the sun,<br>
72        He rais'd his azure wand, and thus begun.<br>
<br>
73        Ye Sylphs and Sylphids, to your chief give ear,<br>
74        Fays, Fairies, Genii, Elves, and Dæmons hear!<br>
75        Ye know the spheres and various tasks assign'd<br>
76        By laws eternal to th'aerial kind.<br>
77        Some in the fields of purest Æther play,<br>
78        And bask and whiten in the blaze of day.<br>
79        Some guide the course of wand'ring orbs on high,<br>
80        Or roll the planets thro' the boundless sky.<br>
81        Some less refin'd, beneath the moon's pale light<br>
82        Pursue the stars that shoot athwart the night,<br>
83        Or suck the mists in grosser air below,<br>
84        Or dip their pinions in the painted bow,<br>
85        Or brew fierce tempests on the wintry main,<br>
86        Or o'er the glebe distill the kindly rain.<br>
87        Others on earth o'er human race preside,<br>
88        Watch all their ways, and all their actions guide:<br>
89        Of these the chief the care of Nations own,<br>
90        And guard with Arms divine the British Throne.<br>
<br>
91        Our humbler province is to tend the Fair;<br>
92        Not a less pleasing, tho' less glorious care:<br>
93        To save the powder from too rude a gale,<br>
94        Nor let th'imprison'd essences exhale;<br>
95        To draw fresh colours from the vernal flow'rs;<br>
96        To steal from rainbows e'er they drop in show'rs<br>
97        A brighter wash; to curl their waving hairs,<br>
98        Assist their blushes, and inspire their airs;<br>
99        Nay oft', in dreams, invention we bestow,<br>
100      To change a Flounce, or add a Furbelow.<br>
<br>
101      This day, black Omens threat the brightest Fair<br>
102      That e'er deserv'd a watchful spirit's care;<br>
103      Some dire disaster, or by force, or slight;<br>
104      But what, or where, the fates have wrapt in night.<br>
105      Whether the nymph shall break Diana's law,<br>
106      Or some frail China jar receive a flaw,<br>
107      Or stain her honour, or her new brocade,<br>
108      Forget her pray'rs, or miss a masquerade,<br>
109      Or lose her heart, or necklace, at a ball;<br>
110      Or whether Heav'n has doom'd that Shock must fall.<br>
111      Haste then, ye spirits! to your charge repair;<br>
112      The flutt'ring fan be Zephyretta's care;<br>
113      The drops to thee, Brillante, we consign;<br>
114      And, Momentilla, let the watch be thine;<br>
115      Do thou, Crispissa, tend her fav'rite Lock;<br>
116      Ariel himself shall be the guard of Shock.<br>
<br>
117      To fifty chosen Sylphs, of special note,<br>
118      We trust th'important charge, the Petticoat:<br>
119      Oft' have we known that seven-fold fence to fail,<br>
120      Tho' stiff with hoops, and arm'd with ribs of whale.<br>
121      Form a strong line about the silver bound,<br>
122      And guard the wide circumference around.<br>
<br>
123      Whatever spirit, careless of his charge,<br>
124      His post neglects, or leaves the fair at large<br>,
125      Shall feel sharp vengeance soon o'ertake his sins,<br>
126      Be stop'd in vials, or transfix'd with pins;<br>
127      Or plung'd in lakes of bitter washes lie,<br>
128      Or wedg'd whole ages in a bodkin's eye:<br>
129      Gums and Pomatums shall his flight restrain,<br>
130      While clog'd he beats his silken wings in vain;<br>
131      Or Alom stypticks with contracting pow'r<br>
132      Shrink his thin essence like a rivell'd flow'r:<br>
133      Or as Ixion fix'd, the wretch shall feel<br>
134      The giddy motion of the whirling Mill,<br>
135      In fumes of burning Chocolate shall glow,<br>
136      And tremble at the sea that froaths below!<br>
<br>
137      He spoke; the spirits from the sails descend;<br>
138      Some, orb in orb, around the nymph extend;<br>
139      Some thrid the mazy ringlets of her hair;<br>
140      Some hang upon the pendants of her ear;<br>
141      With beating hearts the dire event they wait,<br>
142      Anxious, and trembling for the birth of Fate.<br>

25        Belinda now, whom thirst of fame invites,<br>

27        At Ombre singly to decide their doom;<br>
28        And swells her breast with conquests yet to come.<br>
29        Strait the three bands prepare in arms to join,<br>
30        Each band the number of the sacred nine.<br>
31        Soon as she spreads her hand, th'aerial guard<br>
32        Descend, and sit on each important card:<br>
33        First Ariel perch'd upon a Matadore,<br>
34        Then each, according to the rank they bore;<br>
35        For Sylphs, yet mindful of their ancient race,<br>
36        Are, as when women, wondrous fond of place.<br>
<br>

38        With hoary whiskers and a forky beard;<br>
39        And four fair Queens whose hands sustain a flow'r,<br>
40        Th' expressive emblem of their softer pow'r;<br>
41        Four Knaves in garbs succinct, a trusty band,<br>
42        Caps on their heads, and halberts in their hand;<br>
43        And particolour'd troops, a shining train,<br>
44        Draw forth to combat on the velvet plain.<br>
45        The skilful Nymph reviews her force with care:<br>
46        Let Spades be trumps! she said, and trumps they were.<br>
<br>
47        Now move to war her sable Matadores,<br>
48        In show like leaders of the swarthy Moors.<br>
49        Spadillio first, unconquerable Lord!<br>
50        Led off two captive trumps, and swept the board.<br>
51        As many more Manillio forc'd to yield,<br>
52        And march'd a victor from the verdant field.<br>
53        Him Basto follow'd, but his fate more hard<br>
54        Gain'd but one trump and one Plebeian card.<br>
55        With his broad sabre next, a chief in years,<br>
56        The hoary Majesty of Spades appears,<br>
57        Puts forth one manly leg, to sight reveal'd,<br>
58        The rest, his many-colour'd robe conceal'd.<br>
59        The rebel Knave, who dares his prince engage,<br>
60        Proves the just victim of his royal rage.<br>
61        Ev'n mighty Pam, that Kings and Queens o'erthrew,<br>

70        Spite of his haughty mien, and barb'rous pride:<br>
71        What boots the regal circle on his head,<br>
72        His giant limbs, in state unwieldly spread;<br>
73        That long behind he trails his pompous robe,<br>
74        And, of all monarchs, only grasps the globe?<br>
75        The Baron now his Diamonds pours apace;<br>
76        Th' embroider'd King who shows but half his face,<br>

79        Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, in wild disorder seen,<br>
80        With throngs promiscuous strow the level green.<br>
81        Thus when dispers'd a routed army runs,<br>
82        Of Asia's troops, and Afric's sable sons,<br>
83        With like confusion different nations fly,<br>
84        Of various habit, and of various dye,<br>
85        The pierc'd battalions dis-united fall,<br>
86        In heaps on heaps; one fate o'erwhelms them all.<br>
<br>
87        The Knave of Diamonds tries his wily arts,<br>
88        And wins (oh shameful chance!) the Queen of Hearts.<br>
89        At this, the blood the virgin's cheek forsook,<br>
90        A livid paleness spreads o'er all her look;<br>
91        She sees, and trembles at th'approaching ill,<br>
92        Just in the jaws of ruin, and Codille.<br>
93        And now, (as oft' in some distemper'd State)<br>
94        On one nice Trick depends the gen'ral fate.<br>
95        An Ace of Hearts steps forth: The King unseen<br>
96        Lurk'd in her hand, and mourn'd his captive Queen:<br>
97        He springs to vengeance with an eager pace,<br>
98        And falls like thunder on the prostrate Ace.<br>
99        The nymph exulting fills with shouts the sky;<br>
100      The walls, the woods, and long canals reply.<br>
<br>
101      Oh thoughtless mortals! ever blind to fate,<br>
102      Too soon dejected, and too soon elate!<br>
103      Sudden, these honours shall be snatch'd away,<br>
104      And curs'd for ever this victorious day.<br>
<br>
105      For lo! the board with cups and spoons is crown'd,> <br>
106      The berries crackle, and the mill turns round;<br>
107      On shining Altars of Japan they raise<br>
108      The silver lamp; the fiery spirits blaze:<br>
109      From silver spouts the grateful liquors glide,<br>
110      While China's earth receives the smoaking tyde:<br>
111      At once they gratify their scent and taste,<br>
112      And frequent cups prolong the rich repaste.<br>
113      Strait hover round the Fair her airy band;<br>
114      Some, as she sipp'd, the fuming liquor fann'd,<br>
115      Some o'er her lap their careful plumes display'd,<br>
116      Trembling, and conscious of the rich brocade.<br>
117      Coffee, (which makes the politician wise,<br>
118      And see thro' all things with his half-shut eyes)<br>
119      Sent up in vapours to the Baron's brain<br>
120      New stratagems, the radiant Lock to gain.<br>
121      Ah cease, rash youth! desist e'er 'tis too late,<br>
122      Fear the just Gods, and think of Scylla's Fate!<br>
123      Chang'd to a bird, and sent to flit in air,<br>
124      She dearly pays for Nisus' injur'd hair!<br>
<br>
125      But when to mischief mortals bend their will,<br>
126      How soon they find fit instruments of ill?<br>
127      Just then, Clarissa drew with tempting grace<br>
128      A two-edg'd weapon from her shining case;<br>
129      So Ladies in Romance assist their Knight,<br>
130      Present the spear, and arm him for the fight.<br>
131      He takes the gift with rev'rence, and extends<br>
132      The little engine on his finger's ends;<br>
133      This just behind Belinda's neck he spread,<br>
134      As o'er the fragrant steams she bends her head.<br>
135      Swift to the Lock a thousand Sprites repair,<br>
136      A thousand wings, by turns, blow back the hair;<br>
137      And thrice they twitch'd the diamond in her ear;<br>
138      Thrice she look'd back, and thrice the foe drew near.<br>
139      Just in that instant, anxious Ariel sought<br>
140      The close recesses of the Virgin's thought;<br>
141      As on the nosegay in her breast reclin'd,<br>
142      He watch'd th'Ideas rising in her mind,<br>
143      Sudden he view'd, in spite of all her art,<br>
144      An earthly Lover lurking at her heart.<br>
145      Amaz'd, confus'd, he found his pow'r expir'd,<br>
146      Resign'd to fate, and with a sigh retir'd.<br>
<br>
147      The Peer now spreads the glitt'ring Forfex wide,<br>
148      T'inclose the Lock; now joins it, to divide.<br>
149      Ev'n then, before the fatal engine clos'd,<br>
150      A wretched Sylph too fondly interpos'd;<br>
151      Fate urg'd the sheers, and cut the Sylph in twain,<br>
152      (But airy substance soon unites again)<br>
153      The meeting points the sacred hair dissever<br>
154      From the fair head, for ever, and for ever!<br>
<br>
155      Then flash'd the living lightning from her eyes,<br>
156      And screams of horror rend th'affrighted skies.<br>
157      Not louder shrieks to pitying heav'n are cast,<br>
158      When husbands or when lapdogs breathe their last;<br>
159      Or when rich China vessels fall'n from high,<br>
160      In glitt'ring dust, and painted fragments lie!<br>
<br>
161      Let wreaths of triumph now my temples twine,<br>
162      (The Victor cry'd) the glorious Prize is mine!<br>
163      While fish in streams, or birds delight in air,<br>
164      Or in a Coach and six the British Fair,<br>
165      As long as Atalantis shall be read,<br>
166      Or the small pillow grace a Lady's bed,<br>
167      While visits shall be paid on solemn days,<br>
168      When num'rous wax-lights in bright order blaze,<br>
169      While nymphs take treats, or assignations give,<br>
170      So long my honour, name, and praise shall live!<br>
<br>
171      What Time wou'd spare, from Steel receives its date,<br>
172      And monuments, like men, submit to fate!<br>
173      Steel could the labour of the Gods destroy,<br>
174      And strike to dust th'imperial tow'rs of Troy;<br>
175      Steel could the works of mortal pride confound,<br>
176      And hew triumphal arches to the ground.<br>
177      What wonder then, fair nymph! thy hairs shou'd feel<br>
178      The conqu'ring force of unresisted steel?<br>

34        Faints into airs and languishes with pride,<br>
35        On the rich quilt sinks with becoming woe,<br>

48        Of bodies chang'd to various forms by Spleen.<br>
49        Here living Tea-pots stand, one arm held out,<br>
50        One bent; the handle this, and that the spout:<br>
51        A Pipkin there, like Homer's Tripod walks;<br>
52        Here sighs a Jar, and there a Goose-pye talks;<br>

58        Who rule the sex to fifty from fifteen:<br>
59        Parent of vapours and of female wit,<br>
60        Who give th'hysteric, or poetic fit,<br>
61        On various tempers act by various ways,<br>
62        Make some take physic, others scribble plays;<br>
63        Who cause the proud their visits to delay,<br>
64        And send the godly in a pett, to pray.<br>
65        A Nymph there is, that all thy pow'r disdains,<br>
66        And thousands more in equal mirth maintains.<br>
67        But oh! if e'er thy Gnome could spoil a grace,<br>
68        Or raise a pimple on a beauteous face,<br>
69        Like Citron-waters matrons cheeks inflame,<br>
70        Or change complexions at a losing game;<br>
71        If e'er with airy horns I planted heads,<br>
72        Or rumpled petticoats, or tumbled beds,<br>
73        Or caus'd suspicion when no soul was rude,<br>
74        Or discompos'd the head-dress of a Prude,<br>
75        Or e'er to costive lap-dog gave disease,<br>
76        Which not the tears of brightest eyes could ease:<br>
77        Hear me, and touch Belinda with chagrin:<br>
78        That single act gives half the world the spleen.<br>
<br>
79        The Goddess with a discontented air<br>
80        Seems to reject him, tho' she grants his pray'r.<br>
81        A wond'rous Bag with both her hands she binds,<br>
82        Like that where once Ulysses held the winds;<br>
83        There she collects the force of female lungs,<br>
84        Sighs, sobs, and passions, and the war of tongues.<br>
85        A Vial next she fills with fainting fears,<br>
86        Soft sorrows, melting griefs, and flowing tears.<br>
87        The Gnome rejoicing bears her gifts away,<br>
88        Spreads his black wings, and slowly mounts to day.<br>
<br>
89        Sunk in Thalestris' arms the nymph he found,<br>
90        Her eyes dejected and her hair unbound.<br>
91        Full o'er their heads the swelling bag he rent,<br>
92        And all the Furies issued at the vent.<br>
93        Belinda burns with more than mortal ire,<br>
94        And fierce Thalestris fans the rising fire.<br>
95        O wretched maid! she spread her hands, and cry'd,<br>
96        (While Hampton's echoes, wretched maid! reply'd)<br>
97        Was it for this you took such constant care<br>
98        The bodkin, comb, and essence to prepare?<br>
99        For this your locks in paper durance bound,<br>
100      For this with tort'ring irons wreath'd around?<br>
101      For this with fillets strain'd your tender head,<br>
102      And bravely bore the double loads of lead?<br>
103      Gods! shall the ravisher display your hair,<br>
104      While the Fops envy, and the Ladies stare!<br>
105      Honour forbid! at whose unrival'd shrine<br>
106      Ease, pleasure, virtue, all our sex resign.<br>
107      Methinks already I your tears survey,<br>
108      Already hear the horrid things they say,<br>
109      Already see you a degraded toast,<br>
110      And all your honour in a whisper lost!<br>
111      How shall I, then, your helpless fame defend?<br>
112      'Twill then be infamy to seem your friend!<br>
113      And shall this prize, th'inestimable prize,<br>
114      Expos'd thro' crystal to the gazing eyes,<br>
115      And heighten'd by the diamond's circling rays,<br>
116      On that rapacious hand for ever blaze?<br>
117      Sooner shall grass in Hyde-park Circus grow,<br>
118      And wits take lodgings in the sound of Bow;<br>
119      Sooner let earth, air, sea, to Chaos fall,<br>
120      Men, monkeys, lap-dogs, parrots, perish all!<br>
<br>
121      She said; then raging to Sir Plume repairs,<br>
122      And bids her Beau demand the precious hairs:<br>
123      (Sir Plume, of amber Snuff-box justly vain,<br>
124      And the nice conduct of a clouded cane)<br>
125      With earnest eyes, and round unthinking face,<br>
126      He first the snuff-box open'd, then the case,<br>
127      And thus broke out---"My Lord, why, what the devil?<br>
128      "Z---ds! damn the lock! 'fore Gad, you must be civil!<br>
129      "Plague on't! 'tis past a jest---nay prithee, pox!<br>
130      "Give her the hair"---he spoke, and rapp'd his box.<br>
<br>
131      It grieves me much (reply'd the Peer again)<br>
132      Who speaks so well should ever speak in vain.<br>
<br>
133      But by this Lock, this sacred Lock I swear,<br>
134      (Which never more shall join its parted hair;<br>
135      Which never more its honours shall renew,<br>
136      Clip'd from the lovely head where late it grew)<br>
137      That while my nostrils draw the vital air,<br>
138      This hand which won it, shall for ever wear.<br>
139      He spoke, and speaking, in proud triumph spread<br>
140      The long-contended honours of her head.<br>
<br>
141      But Umbriel, hateful Gnome! forbears not so;<br>
142      He breaks the Vial whence the sorrows flow.<br>
143      Then see! the nymph in beauteous grief appears,<br>
144      Her eyes half-languishing, half-drown'd in tears;<br>
145      On her heav'd bosom hung her drooping head,<br>
146      Which, with a sigh, she rais'd; and thus she said.<br>
<br>
147      For ever curs'd be this detested day,<br>
148      Which snatch'd my best, my fav'rite curl away!<br>
149      Happy! ah ten times happy had I been,<br>
150      If Hampton-Court these eyes had never seen!<br>
151      Yet am not I the first mistaken maid,<br>
152      By love of Courts to num'rous ills betray'd.<br>
153      Oh had I rather un-admir'd remain'd<br>
154      In some lone isle, or distant Northern land;<br>
155      Where the gilt Chariot never marks the way,<br>
156      Where none learn Ombre, none e'er taste Bohea!<br>
157      There kept my charms conceal'd from mortal eye,<br>
158      Like roses, that in desarts bloom and die.<br>
159      What mov'd my mind with youthful Lords to roam?<br>
160      O had I stay'd, and said my pray'rs at home!<br>
161      'Twas this, the morning omens seem'd to tell;<br>
162      Thrice from my trembling hand the patch-box fell;<br>
163      The tott'ring China shook without a wind,<br>
164      Nay Poll sate mute, and Shock was most unkind!<br>
165      A Sylph too warn'd me of the threats of fate,<br>
166      In mystic visions, now believ'd too late!<br>
167      See the poor remnants of these slighted hairs!<br>
168      My hands shall rend what ev'n thy rapine spares:<br>
169      These, in two sable ringlets taught to break,<br>
170      Once gave new beauties to the snowy neck;<br>
171      The sister-lock now sits uncouth, alone,<br>
172      And in its fellow's fate foresees its own;<br>
173      Uncurl'd it hangs, the fatal sheers demands,<br>
174      And tempts once more thy sacrilegious hands.<br>
175      Oh hadst thou, cruel! been content to seize<br>
176      Hairs less in sight, or any hairs but these!<br>

1          She said: the pitying audience melt in tears.<br>
2          But Fate and Jove had stopp'd the Baron's ears.<br>
3          In vain Thalestris with reproach assails,<br>
4          For who can move when fair Belinda fails?<br>
5          Not half so fix'd the Trojan could remain,<br>
6          While Anna begg'd and Dido rage'd in vain.<br>
7          Then grave Clarissa graceful wav'd her fan;<br>
8          Silence ensu'd, and thus the nymph began.<br>
<br>
9          Say why are Beauties prais'd and honour'd most,<br>
10        The wise man's passion, and the vain man's toast?<br>
11        Why deck'd with all that land and sea afford,<br>
12        Why Angels call'd, and Angel-like ador'd?<br>
13        Why round our coaches croud the white-glov'd Beaus,<br>
14        Why bows the side-box from its inmost rows?<br>
15        How vain are all these glories, all our pains,<br>
16        Unless good sense preserve what beauty gains:<br>
17        That men may say, when we the front-box grace,<br>
18        Behold the first in virtue, as in face!<br>
19        Oh! if to dance all night, and dress all day,<br>
20        Charm'd the small-pox, or chas'd old-age away;<br>
21        Who would not scorn what houswife's cares produce,<br>
22        Or who would learn one earthly thing of use?<br>
23        To patch, nay ogle, might become a Saint,<br>
24        Nor could it sure be such a sin to paint.<br>
25        But since, alas! frail beauty must decay,<br>
26        Curl'd or uncurl'd, since Locks will turn to grey;<br>
27        Since painted, or not painted, all shall fade,<br>
28        And she who scorns a man, must die a maid;<br>
29        What then remains but well our pow'r to use,<br>
30        And keep good-humour still whate'er we lose?<br>
31        And trust me, dear! good-humour can prevail,<br>
32        When airs, and flights, and screams, and scolding fail.<br>
33        Beauties in vain their pretty eyes may roll;<br>
34        Charms strike the sight, but merit wins the soul.<br>
<br>
35        So spoke the Dame, but no applause ensu'd;<br>
36        Belinda frown'd, Thalestris call'd her Prude.<br>
37        To arms, to arms! the fierce Virago cries,<br>
38        And swift as lightning to the combat flies.<br>
39        All side in parties, and begin th'attack;<br>
40        Fans clap, silks russle, and tough whalebones crack;<br>
41        Heroes and Heroines shouts confus'dly rise,<br>
42        And base, and treble voices strike the skies.<br>
43        No common weapons in their hands are found,<br>
44        Like Gods they fight, nor dread a mortal wound.<br>
<br>
45        So when bold Homer makes the Gods engage,<br>
46        And heav'nly breasts with human passions rage;<br>
47        'Gainst Pallas, Mars; Latona, Hermes arms;<br>
48        And all Olympus rings with loud alarms:<br>
49        Jove's thunder roars, heav'n trembles all around;<br>
50        Blue Neptune storms, the bellowing deeps resound;<br>
51        Earth shakes her nodding tow'rs, the ground gives way,<br>
52        And the pale ghosts start at the flash of day!<br>
<br>
53        Triumphant Umbriel on a sconce's height<br>
54        Clap'd his glad wings, and sate to view the fight:<br>
55        Prop'd on their bodkin spears, the Sprites survey<br>
56        The growing combat, or assist the fray.<br>
<br>
57        While thro' the press enrag'd Thalestris flies,<br>
58        And scatters deaths around from both her eyes,<br>
59        A Beau and Witling perish'd in the throng,<br>
60        One dy'd in metaphor, and one in song.<br>
61        "O cruel nymph! a living death I bear,"<br>
62        Cry'd Dapperwit, and sunk beside his chair.<br>
63        A mournful glance Sir Fopling upwards cast,<br>
64        Those eyes are made so killing---was his last.<br>
65        Thus on Mæander's flow'ry margin lies<br>
66        Th'expiring Swan, and as he sings he dies.<br>
<br>
67        When bold Sir Plume had drawn Clarissa down,<br>
68        Chloe stepp'd in, and kill'd him with a frown;<br>
69        She smil'd to see the doughty hero slain,<br>
70        But, at her smile, the Beau reviv'd again.<br>
<br>
71        Now Jove suspends his golden scales in air,<br>
72        Weighs the Men's wits against the Lady's hair;<br>
73        The doubtful beam long nods from side to side;<br>
74        At length the wits mount up, the hairs subside.<br>
<br>
75        See fierce Belinda on the Baron flies,<br>
76        With more than usual lightning in her eyes:<br>
77        Nor fear'd the Chief th'unequal fight to try,<br>
78        Who sought no more than on his foe to die.<br>
79        But this bold Lord with manly strength endu'd,<br>
80        She with one finger and a thumb subdu'd:<br>
81        Just where the breath of life his nostrils drew,<br>
82        A charge of Snuff the wily virgin threw;<br>
83        The Gnomes direct, to ev'ry atome just,<br>
84        The pungent grains of titillating dust.<br>
85        Sudden, with starting tears each eye o'erflows,<br>
86        And the high dome re-echoes to his nose.<br>
<br>
87        Now meet thy fate, incens'd Belinda cry'd,<br>
88        And drew a deadly bodkin from her side.<br>
89        The same, his ancient personage to deck,<br>
90        Her great great grandsire wore about his neck,<br>
91        In three seal-rings; which after, melted down,<br>
92        Form'd a vast buckle for his widow's gown:<br>
93        Her infant grandame's whistle next it grew,<br>
94        The bells she jingled, and the whistle blew;<br>
95        Then in a bodkin grac'd her mother's hairs,<br>
96        Which long she wore, and now Belinda wears.)<br>
<br>
97        Boast not my fall (he cry'd) insulting foe!<br>
98        Thou by some other shalt be laid as low.<br>
99        Nor think, to die dejects my lofty mind:<br>
100      All that I dread is leaving you behind!<br>
101      Rather than so, ah let me still survive,<br>
102      And burn in Cupid's flames,---but burn alive.<br>
<br>
103      Restore the Lock! she cries; and all around<br>
104      Restore the Lock! the vaulted roofs rebound.<br>
105      Not fierce Othello in so loud a strain<br>
106      Roar'd for the handkerchief that caus'd his pain.<br>
107      But see how oft' ambitious aims are cross'd,<br>
108      And chiefs contend 'till all the prize is lost!<br>
109      The Lock, obtain'd with guilt, and kept with pain,<br>
110      In ev'ry place is sought, but sought in vain:<br>
111      With such a prize no mortal must be blest,<br>
112      So heav'n decrees! with heav'n who can contest?<br>
<br>
113      Some thought it mounted to the Lunar sphere,<br>
114      Since all things lost on earth are treasur'd there.<br>
115      There Hero's wits are kept in pond'rous vases;<br>
116      And Beau's in snuff-boxes and tweezer-cases.<br>
117      There broken vows, and death-bed alms are found;<br>
118      And lover's hearts with ends of ribband bound,<br>
119      The courtier's promises, and sick man's pray'rs,<br>
120      The smiles of harlots, and the tears of heirs,<br>
121      Cages for gnats, and chains to yoak a flea,<br>
122      Dry'd butterflies, and tomes of casuistry.<br>
<br>
123      But trust the Muse---she saw it upward rise,<br>
124      Tho' mark'd by none but quick, poetic eyes:<br>
125      (So Rome's great founder to the heav'ns withdrew,<br>
126      To Proculus alone confess'd in view)<br>
127      A sudden Star, it shot thro' liquid air,<br>
128      And drew behind a radiant trail of hair.<br>
129      Not Berenice's Locks first rose so bright,<br>
130      The heav'ns bespangling with dishevel'd light.<br>
131      The Sylphs behold it kindling as it flies,<br>
132      And pleas'd pursue its progress thro' the skies.<br>
<br>
133      This the Beau-monde shall from the Mall survey,<br>
134      And hail with music its propitious ray.<br>
135      This the blest Lover shall for Venus take,<br>
136      And send up vows from Rosamonda's lake.<br>
137      This Partridge soon shall view in cloudless skies,<br>
138      When next he looks thro' Galilæo's eyes;<br>
139      And hence th' egregious wizard shall foredoom<br>
140      The fate of Louis, and the fall of Rome.<br>
<br>
141      Then cease, bright Nymph! to mourn thy ravish'd hair,<br>
142      Which adds new glory to the shining sphere!<br>
143      Not all the tresses that fair head can boast,<br>
144      Shall draw such envy as the Lock you lost.<br>
145      For, after all the murders of your eye,<br>
146      When, after millions slain, yourself shall die;<br>
147      When those fair suns shall set, as set they must,<br>
148      And all those tresses shall be laid in dust;<br>
149      This Lock, the Muse shall consecrate to fame,<br>
150      And 'midst the stars inscribe Belinda's name.<br>

And could that mighty warrior fall,<br>

The last loud trump must wake him now;<br>
And, trust me, as the noise grows stronger,<br>
He'd wish to sleep a little longer.<br>
And could he be indeed so old<br>
As by the newspapers we're told?<br>
Threescore, I think, is pretty high;<br>
'Twas time in conscience he should die!<br>
This world he cumber'd long enough;<br>
He burnt his candle to the snuff;<br>
And that's the reason, some folks think,<br>
He left behind so great a stink.<br>
Behold his funeral appears,<br>
Nor widows' sighs, nor orphans' tears,<br>
Wont at such times each heart to pierce,<br>

By haughty Celia spent in dressing;<br>
The goddess from her chamber issues,<br>
Arrayed in lace, brocades, and tissues.<br>
<br>
Strephon, who found the room was void<br>
And Betty otherwise employed,<br>
Stole in and took a strict survey<br>
Of all the litter as it lay;<br>
Whereof, to make the matter clear,<br>
An inventory follows here.<br>
<br>
And first a dirty smock appeared,<br>
Beneath the arm-pits well besmeared.<br>
Strephon, the rogue, displayed it wide<br>
And turned it round on every side.<br>
On such a point few words are best,<br>
And Strephon bids us guess the rest;<br>
And swears how damnably the men lie<br>
In calling Celia sweet and cleanly.<br>
Now listen while he next produces<br>
The various combs for various uses,<br>
Filled up with dirt so closely fixt,<br>
No brush could force a way betwixt.<br>
A paste of composition rare,<br>
Sweat, dandruff, powder, lead and hair;<br>
A forehead cloth with oil upon't<br>
To smooth the wrinkles on her front.<br>
Here alum flower to stop the steams<br>
Exhaled from sour unsavory streams;<br>
There night-gloves made of Tripsy's hide,<br>
Bequeath'd by Tripsy when she died,<br>
With puppy water, beauty's help,<br>
Distilled from Tripsy's darling whelp;<br>
Here gallypots and vials placed,<br>
Some filled with washes, some with paste,<br>
Some with pomatum, paints and slops,<br>
And ointments good for scabby chops.<br>
Hard by a filthy basin stands,<br>
Fouled with the scouring of her hands;<br>
The basin takes whatever comes,<br>
The scrapings of her teeth and gums,<br>
A nasty compound of all hues,<br>
For here she spits, and here she spews.<br>
But oh! it turned poor Strephon's bowels,<br>
When he beheld and smelt the towels,<br>
Begummed, besmattered, and beslimed<br>
With dirt, and sweat, and ear-wax grimed.<br>
No object Strephon's eye escapes:<br>
Here petticoats in frowzy heaps;<br>
Nor be the handkerchiefs forgot<br>
All varnished o'er with snuff and snot.<br>
The stockings, why should I expose,<br>
Stained with the marks of stinking toes;<br>
Or greasy coifs and pinners reeking,<br>
Which Celia slept at least a week in?<br>
A pair of tweezers next he found<br>
To pluck her brows in arches round,<br>
Or hairs that sink the forehead low,<br>
Or on her chin like bristles grow.<br>
<br>
The virtues we must not let pass,<br>
Of Celia's magnifying glass.<br>
When frighted Strephon cast his eye on't<br>
It shewed the visage of a giant.<br>
A glass that can to sight disclose<br>
The smallest worm in Celia's nose,<br>
And faithfully direct her nail<br>
To squeeze it out from head to tail;<br>
(For catch it nicely by the head,<br>
It must come out alive or dead.)<br>
<br>
Why Strephon will you tell the rest?<br>
And must you needs describe the chest?<br>
That careless wench! no creature warn her<br>
To move it out from yonder corner;<br>
But leave it standing full in sight<br>
For you to exercise your spite.<br>
In vain, the workman shewed his wit<br>
With rings and hinges counterfeit<br>
To make it seem in this disguise<br>
A cabinet to vulgar eyes;<br>
For Strephon ventured to look in,<br>
Resolved to go through thick and thin;<br>
He lifts the lid, there needs no more:<br>
He smelt it all the time before.<br>
As from within Pandora's box,<br>
When Epimetheus oped the locks,<br>
A sudden universal crew<br>
Of humane evils upwards flew,<br>
He still was comforted to find<br>
That Hope at last remained behind;<br>
So Strephon lifting up the lid<br>
To view what in the chest was hid,<br>
The vapours flew from out the vent.<br>
But Strephon cautious never meant<br>
The bottom of the pan to grope<br>
And foul his hands in search of Hope.<br>
O never may such vile machine<br>
Be once in Celia's chamber seen!<br>
O may she better learn to keep<br>
"Those secrets of the hoary deep"!<br>
<br>
As mutton cutlets, prime of meat,<br>
Which, though with art you salt and beat<br>
As laws of cookery require<br>
And toast them at the clearest fire,<br>
If from adown the hopeful chops<br>
The fat upon the cinder drops,<br>
To stinking smoke it turns the flame<br>
Poisoning the flesh from whence it came;<br>
And up exhales a greasy stench<br>
For which you curse the careless wench;<br>
So things which must not be exprest,<br>
When plumpt into the reeking chest,<br>
Send up an excremental smell<br>
To taint the parts from whence they fell,<br>
The petticoats and gown perfume,<br>
Which waft a stink round every room.<br>
<br>
Thus finishing his grand survey,<br>
Disgusted Strephon stole away<br>
Repeating in his amorous fits,<br>
Oh! Celia, Celia, Celia shits!<br>
<br>
But vengeance, Goddess never sleeping,<br>
Soon punished Strephon for his peeping:<br>
His foul Imagination links<br>
Each dame he see with all her stinks;<br>
And, if unsavory odors fly,<br>
Conceives a lady standing by.<br>
All women his description fits,<br>
And both ideas jump like wits<br>
By vicious fancy coupled fast,<br>
And still appearing in contrast.<br>
<br>
I pity wretched Strephon blind<br>
To all the charms of female kind.<br>
Should I the Queen of Love refuse<br>
Because she rose from stinking ooze?<br>
To him that looks behind the scene<br>
Satira's but some pocky queen.<br>
When Celia in her glory shows,<br>
If Strephon would but stop his nose<br>
(Who now so impiously blasphemes<br>
Her ointments, daubs, and paints and creams,<br>
Her washes, slops, and every clout<br>
With which he makes so foul a rout),<br>
He soon would learn to think like me<br>
And bless his ravished sight to see<br>
Such order from confusion sprung,<br>
Such gaudy tulips raised from dung.<br>

(We shan't dispute a Year or more)<br>
However Stella, be not troubled,<br>
Although thy Size and Years are doubled,<br>
Since first I saw Thee at Sixteen<br>
The brightest Virgin on the Green,<br>
So little is thy Form declin'd<br>
Made up so largely in thy Mind.<br>
Oh, woud it please the Gods to split<br>
Thy Beauty, Size, and Years, and Wit,<br>
No Age could furnish out a Pair<br>
Of Nymphs so graceful, Wise and fair<br>
With half the Lustre of your Eyes,<br>
With half your Wit, your Years and Size:<br>
And then before it grew too late,<br>
How should I beg of gentle Fate,<br>
(That either Nymph might have her Swain,)<br>
To split my Worship too in twain.<br>
