        fact is a drab trauma, an ontological. It is therefore useless. An act 
        with nope (existence a self with pictures (things do have periods - they&#8217;re 
        seen) (a self is what you rent from christmas (I, being that what synchronises 
        doubt, like look synchronise the same))), like subjects, connects facts. 
        I mean the question ain&#8217;t my agent, the rest of the sentence is 
        nostalgic. For the subject. The shortest route from cause to effect. It&#8217;s 
        so neurotic it confesses to the past (a media, or perjury, or other financial 
        capital). But it&#8217;s seen to pseud. A dilettante&#8217;s masochist. 
        Ah, price she is a beautiful thing. <br>
        <br>
        The idea that a conversation is normally held between two people was introduced 
        with the novel. It was sold with the phone. It came as a subsidiary of 
        hello, and hello as we all know is dutch for surveillance. Alex Bell invented 
        the telephone because he wanted to talk with his brother. Who was dead. 
        He employed Watson as his engineer because he was a known psychic. In 
        Salem. Their mother who was deaf. I mean, with two billion people earning 
        less than two dollars a day and another two billion less than one dollar 
        a day, how can you get a wrong number? Choice she is obsequious, an itch, 
        a assume (nouns all but blindspots on the take, a -er list without the 
        grace): onetwo was a sadist too, sue. (That an act is software makes of 
        course no diff, the plug is in the fridge.) Selling deadline. To the fish. 
        Therapy. Listening is double standard. Coz. <br>
        <br>
        Surveillance, a chain letter kitshy too-true (the right to not mean ain&#8217;t 
        so pretty as like a duck), buys more: action (cheap work (english is a 
        yellow form of gravity (and loses data by the truck)) the last way known 
        of keeping score: it&#8217;s only stressing the second syllable that ever 
        results in the sense, an iambic am, with biz (any on (as in switch that 
        fucker on) is an line, witness). Like if an event horizon spoke english, 
        would you know? My past the narcissist shows up the gift: lift, art of 
        the (curated) switch. (The grammar market: the average utterance in english 
        is seventytwo phonemes. Two seconds. And every hundred phonemes we kill 
        someone.)<br>
        <br>
        The measurement problem: it is unlikely that red will be deduced as an 
        approximation of french, unless. That this demands ignorance of that defines 
        grace, a just at. (That space the definition hospitality, the warmth of 
        betrayal (intention the guest with the twenty dollar plate (guilt has 
        it&#8217;s own reflected glory, a hand embroidered porn)) (On reforming 
        the speed of light by having opinion about pink): I&#8217;m Sorry in the 
        third race gets the bait.) (Capitalism is a tax. And thus escapes it&#8217;s 
        own colonisation. Use thinks of it as the idealism of need, an and character 
        of poor dimension, rhetorically accident. But redundancy adapts. Complacent.)

        <br>
        The um of ah, the a par&#8217;dox superstiting symptom distance, the state 
        (a mediocre), kitsch (thing, a bourgeois pet (for those who thought truth 
        too sentimental)), a microsoft scientology, the here effect (one is an 
        experimental site of two) that loopholes tunes as little fictions (the 
        same is a category mistake (it comes in blue) a two three irony with cream), 
        a dictionary of please, a tacit twitch the square of sees in<br>
        <br>
        Apart from being juvenile, knowledge plain bad luck (I mean if thing other 
        than some contradict then any price quite right), addition just a pretty 
        way of winning argument: Acquisitive like logic were the event, and then: 
        Things, a dictionary of prediction with which (context, where output is 
        jealous of its input) we itch, is pissed, awkward list, and ing: and coz 
        the end of a sentence alway hard in english, bribe it, the silent of too 
        much like, the fuck shut up, a rough mum purient shit.<br>

        Media, the aesthetics of maybe (translate english into language was not 
        a bad idea, a hybrid of access and stuttering (english being censorship 
        by rote, a flat distraction) (profit is not an algorithm), the on enigma, 
        the collectively intelligent object (it anyway looks like an experience, 
        a user interface of charm...). Then there were you.<br>
        <br>
        Capricious, it compensates, mitigates. The regress of agency, the contaminate 
        by convenience, an atrophy of the ignored (ie data (a picture on the edge 
        of means)) bored and mannered, the counterfeit looks to concentrate: Consciousness 
        was invented last week. I know coz I were there, a truth in trouser, zip. 
        It is the italic of mine, a sticky finger english symptom (history some 
        medication) that(of course the possessed speak languages they don&#8217;t 
        understand)&#8217;ll do.<br>
        <br>
        The archaeology of yes, an autism (that my fact can&#8217;t blink is no 
        great shakes, it&#8217;s more a lack of), a low-cost lang&#8217;age (nouns 
        is a private practice, a picture risk of the disabled, a credit slip), 
        an interface only works if stupid (and while the difficult&#8217;s an 
        observant joy, price the badge pathetic). <br>
        <br>
        The past, the anxiety of the present, applies to be a subject, a failed 
        transcendence: Hymn to decideability: the slow fact, sits, pimp simple, 
        it fiction, fixed bewildered news is a toy, a symmetry bit (things, the 
        senility of grammar) noise (the state is a secret kept by those that it 
        employs), a dimensionless horizon which dobs on me by laying low, so<br>
        <br>
        And though language the occurrence of groups, the more, the less ambiguous 
        the speech. They them then substitutes for language, calls a resource, 
        a paid censorship by fact. (Three she is a blindspot, says here just as 
        much (like if some too close together, a irritants distract the fit), 
        symbolic like a journo on the touch.) But definition it a hero (a case 
        worker with a maid) and addition immature, but fiction, though, an aid

        A noun, a narcissist without a centre (to the extent that it&#8217;s news 
        is it worthless), a function of what you know but can&#8217;t yet think, 
        salvation, a charity poured over a that, where it sticks is called facts 
        or blindspots or the past, and where it don&#8217;t is called psychology, 
        language is distinguished from mathematics by virtue of it&#8217;s not 
        being jealous of its own shortest description. And being a shorter description 
        than its proof it remains of course too true. Feedback, the fat battery, 
        does just that (the dark matter there on the left, the one in the hat), 
        the dull dimension of consciousness. See: later<br>
        <br>
        mortgage: the history of natural selection being the history of selection 
        for pain, logic is not here a conscious observer (or, why apples is not 
        their own dimension (seven is a dimension)), but it does leak (only in 
        baking is the question is the square root of the answer, though tarts 
        is too numerically deep to<br>
        <br>
        logic: being the (thin) worm hole connects dimensions (the same is that 
        part of the same what&#8217;s diff) it shits subjects and these subjects 
        measure (the observer is the hit of any system and waddles in anticipates) 
        which means these comes in negatives and the (you too) negatives es is 
        es.<br>
        <br>
        profit: the square of a distinction, a pun on decorative theres and their 
        parking fines (only in disney do space act like other than a mind): imaginary 
        and fragile, five remains enough, a bit we schiz redundant, an ish with 
        itch, a retarded version of before, a, and though there be probably a 
        universe where I exists,<br>

        stuck like cunt in sec dimension, we. (The algorithm of on (coz it rhymes 
        with right), a collapsed eavesdrop of long shot clones and better odds,

        but the pathetic of ignorance, decis&#8217; its celebration)):<br>
        <br>
        thing: a pack of warmed over nots are both redundantly stable enough to 
        ensure coherence as well as a lame ambivalence, a same on speed (insurance 
        is the pretty law of observation, the plastic tax (get that fucker on 
        her knees, negation&#8217;s just picture maths for code)). (Context, the 
        best expensive part of any system, flirts with the gift of cash<br>

        not all facts is decorative, some are just plain wrong: entropy remains 
        a bargain (one just the environment of two), a thing mere some black box 
        of collateral damage. It interferes. With mass. Yeah yeah. Like you call 
        that an event horizon? I mean it&#8217;s not even all there. (The future

        A fact is an adolescent standard. Has nappy rash. A crap kitsch this that, 
        a colloquial pause, a fact is only unconsciously relaxed, copy logic proxied 
        up to get a look at, a pretty pocket: and is not but what it was - it 
        conjugates fits, with. A fiction sees a picture with a hole. An empirical. 
        All. And. Existence is logically necessary. A A logical and B. That&#8217;s 
        why I invented it. No, actually that&#8217;s why I did it. It&#8217;s 
        nice. A quasi-me-fictu pos with diction up the arse, a quite. (A word, 
        a portable context that smiles a lot, then dobs me in, so now, not only 
        more, is I&#8217;s routine.)<br>
        <br>
        Decoration is a logical principle. Or, why is context so poor? (On the 
        possibility of conversation being a rule and therefore impossible (I mean 
        it&#8217;s clearly not a name (knowledge jus a blind revenge)): the picture 
        is a big picture and therefore evidence (an event is an example of that 
        between the general and its &#8217;ticulars (the negative, a forlorn fetish 
        of repetition)) of the invisibility of law, pet paranoia, kept. (The picture 
        aint no add-on and therefore&#8217;s without hope, a dunno in was and 
        other whatsits, a pack of grammar yea high, or close enough (love is one 
        them pics of grammar don&#8217;t show what at all) to bluff the soap with. 
        And the fictional looks? Like looks? A blush on legs. It confess gravity 
        some useful doubt. Gram I mean always run off at the mouth, eavesdrop 
        some preposit. An object&#8217;s a pathology. It covets its own cure.) 
        I on the other hand don&#8217;t mind. It&#8217;s narcissistic at. Its 
        absence, I mean. You see, it trusts. Romancing the and of to. You I mean 
        is not a rational idea. And fail as evidence (evidence, the charity) (fact, 
        the switch) and is therefore possible to be mistaken wrong (though if 
        you were my ego, I&#8217;d only pretend at be wrong (you but still my 
        secret)) - it&#8217;s complacency excludes the voyeur. It with. A complicity 
        string.<br>
        <br>
        &#8216;It&#8217; defines proof. An ideal gimme. And even knowledge weren&#8217;t 
        imperial it&#8217;d is all over the fuckin shop. Like some immune bloody 
        price. &#8216;It&#8217; is the contradict of three. Existence, some pathetic 
        description of, what wants now to be experience, a greed, with chewy farts 
        and other stuff, like you, is full of. An interrupt. The implied I in 
        it. A my rhyme. Time, she say, is up, the fuckin in-between. (Failing 
        as an object, it smiled. A bunch of times. A sweet need please. And if 
        time be so unique, how come the kitsch particular holds it so then togeth? 
        A precautionary ignorance? The fallacy of the past? Coz gifts is classed 
        a knowlidge? Feedback, disney for surveillance (but the site didn know 
        it&#8217;s not a market) (code&#8217;s a node (it imitates)) blows off 
        the diff: logic is a dotcom with a now, a (catatonic) dow on ice. (Nice. 
        But cunt&#8217;s not context &#8217;cept.) Roles (a mole what volunteers 
        as subject to get through), data aspire to be a crime. A reductive but. 
        Rationalised for. Why, did you think there would be two?) <br>
        <br>
        To be is same for square. And projected, it IDs. Thought though only thanks 
        - negation comes as &#8217;pology, pink comeuppance (reason, the pathetic 
        of maybe, the passive of, space was the &#8217;riginal stick. Only not 
        absolved in some surrogate time, like with). I mean, the act adequates 
        its object with the nalogy of sight, a box of onlys. A hid of. Cause, 
        y know, just a way that lot hangin out togeth, a debt. To is, at that, 
        was not enough, but. Like all partics it imitate a law, give lip. Ah stuff 
        it. </font>
